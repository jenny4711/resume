					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>My name is Jiyoun Lee. Based on my varied work experience, 
                        I am pursuing a career pivot to software engineering. Currently, 
                        I am building my skills at Springboard Boot Camp. I take on tasks with the mindset that 
                        challenges and obstacles are opportunities for learning and improving.
                         I would like to work at a place where I can continuously grow within my area of expertise.
                          In the interim, I am learning from others in the field through networking and educational 
                          opportunities.</p>
